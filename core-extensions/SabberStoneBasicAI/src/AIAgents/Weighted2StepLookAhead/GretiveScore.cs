 *		GretiveScore.cs
 *
 *		It contains the definition and specification of the 'score' class for the gretive agent.
 *		Its main function is to store and represent the weights applied in the calculation of the valuation of a game state at a given time.
 *		As a basis, a weight is neither positive nor negative with respect to the player, so it is the user of the instance who must manage that valuation.
